# Simple python calculator
#Functionality
The calculator works by asking the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Performs the operation based on the user's input and print the result. Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, your program should display 20 + 10 = 30. Incase the user divides a value by zero, it brings an error.
